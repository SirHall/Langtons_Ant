# Langtons_Ant
My second Langton's SirHall.Ant implementation

You can find the fully compiled Langtons_Ant.jar under ./out/artifacts/Langtons_Ant_jar.
Though if that for any reason does not work I would recommend just building it locally.


This project was made inside of Jet Brain's 'IntelliJ' and is the recommended IDE for the project.
