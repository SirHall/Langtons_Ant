Implement a Langtons SirHall.Ant derivative in Java. It will most likey include more
colors than the base Langtons SirHall.Ant and will use an image that is read from and written to
as the grid. 

Example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X-gtr4pEBU

When the ant lands on a square of a given color, it will perform the action associated with that 
color and replace that grid with the next color in the list. This is repeated for as long as the 
simulation is run.
